## Where to report a bug

For all attacks and bugs that are performed/discovered you will need to report them to the [Immunefi bug bountry program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/polygon/). Performing an attack and not providing submission of your proof will result in disqualification of your attempt.

You need to make sure that you add all relevant details such as Email address and Discord ID so as to maintain a rapport of communication in case it is required. You would also need to provide as much details as possible so that the Polygon Team can evaluate your submission appropriately.

## What happens after submitting a report

Upon reporting an issue, the Polygon Project team will review and update/comment on the status of the issue. Upon evaluation, the Polygon team will report the outcome of the submission. The Severity will also be tagged as per the evaluation.
