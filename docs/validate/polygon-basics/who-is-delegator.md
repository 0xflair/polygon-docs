Delegators are token holders who cannot, or do not want to run a [validator](/docs/validate/glossary#validator) node themselves. Instead, they secure the network by delegating their stake to validator nodes and play a critical role in the system, as they are responsible for choosing validators. They run their delegation transaction on the staking contract on the Ethereum mainnet.

The MATIC tokens get bonded with the next [checkpoint](/docs/validate/glossary#checkpoint-transaction) committed on the Ethereum mainnet. Delegators also have an option to opt out of the system whenever they want. Similar to validators, delegators have to wait for the unbonding period to end before withdrawing their stake.

## Fees and Rewards

Delegators delegate staking tokens to a validator and obtain a part of their rewards in exchange. Because delegators share rewards with their validators, delegators also share risks. Should a validator misbehave, each of their delegators will be partially slashed in proportion to their delegated stake.

To stake with the validators, delegators pay a [commission](/docs/validate/glossary#commission) to the validator of their choice. Also, they have an option to re-delegate their MATIC tokens with another validator. Rewards are accumulated at every checkpoint.
