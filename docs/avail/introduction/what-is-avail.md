Avail is a blockchain that is laser-focused on data availability:
ordering and recording blockchain transactions, and making it possible
to prove that block data is available without downloading the whole
block. This allows it to scale in ways that monolithic blockchains
cannot.

:::note A Robust General-Purpose Scalable Data Availability Layer

* Enables Layer-2 solutions to offer increased scalability throughput
  by leveraging Avail to build Validiums with off-chain data
  availability.

* Enables standalone chains or sidechains with arbitrary execution
  environments to bootstrap validator security without needing to
  create and manage their own validator set by guaranteeing
  transaction data availability.

### What is the data availability problem?

Peers in a blockchain network need a way to ensure that all the data of a newly proposed block is 
readily available. If the data is not available, the block might contain malicious transactions 
which are being hidden by the block producer. Even if the block contains non-malicious transactions, 
hiding them might compromise the security of the system.

### Avail's approach to data dvailability

#### High Guarantee

Avail provides a provable high level of guarantee that the data is
available. Light clients can independendly verify availability in a
constant number of queries, without downloading the entire block.

#### Minimum Trust

No need to be a validator or host a full node. Even with a light
client, get verifiable availability.

#### Easy to Use

Built using modified Substrate, the solution focuses on ease of use, whether you host an application or
operate an off-chain scaling solution.

#### Perfect for Off-Chain Scaling

Unlock the full scaling potential of your off-chain scaling solution by keeping the data with us and
still avoiding the DA problem on L1.

#### Execution Agnostic

Chains that use Avail can implement any type of execution environment
irrespective of the application logic. Transactions from any
environment are supported: EVM, Wasm, or even new VMs that have not
been built yet. Avail is perfect for experimenting with new execution
layers.

#### Bootstrapping Security

Avail enables new chains to be created without needing to spin up a
new validator set, and leverage Avail's instead. Avail takes care of
transaction sequencing, consensus, and availability in exchange for
simple transaction fees (gas).

#### Fast provable finality using NPoS

Fast provable finality via Nominated Proof of Stake. Backed by KGZ
commitments and erasure coding.
