## Unstoppable networks

Supernets are at the forefront of shaping the next generation of the web, where unstoppable networks hold the key to enabling secure, decentralized, and efficient applications to thrive. These networks must not only be resilient and secure, but also scalable to support the growing demands of the decentralized ecosystem.

The diagram above illustrates the interconnectivity of Supernets with the Polygon PoS network, which is ultimately secured and supported by the security properties of Ethereum.

By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, Supernets offer a robust foundation for building unstoppable networks that can withstand adversarial conditions, resist censorship, and scale to accommodate the increasing demand for processing power, data storage, and transaction throughput.

### Reinforcing network resilience, security, and scalability

Supernets offer enhanced resilience and security by leveraging the inherent properties of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, immutability, and transparency.
To achieve maximum scalability, Supernets employ a multi-faceted approach that leverages a combination of complementary scaling solutions. These solutions include layer-2 scaling techniques, parallelization, and eventually, ZK technology. By integrating these methods, Supernets can efficiently accommodate the increasing demand for processing power, data storage, and transaction throughput as the number of users and applications on the network grows.

## Regulatory Compliance and Network Sovereignty

Supernets serve as a powerful instrument for achieving compliance with local laws and regulations. By providing network sovereignty to operators, Supernets empower operators to select the validators that participate in the network, thus ensuring adherence to local regulations pertaining to data protection, financial transactions, and other domains.

### Jurisdiction-based network management

To further illustrate the concept of network sovereignty, consider an example wherein certain parts of a network are operated in specific regions based on jurisdiction and regulatory requirements. By tailoring network configurations to comply with regional regulations, operators can maintain a globally distributed network while respecting local legal frameworks.

### A new approach to infrastructure

Supernets offer a cutting-edge approach to system infrastructure, with an ecosystem of premium set of implementation, infrastructure, and tooling providers to support them. This ecosystem of service providers empower enterprises and organizations with network sovereignty and regulatory compliance. Organizations can maintain control over network properties and access while experimenting with permissioned and permissionless infrastructure models. The integration of blockchain technology, combined with the expertise of industry-leading partners, provides additional guarantees in terms of security and efficiency, transforming traditional infrastructure designs and models for a more robust and adaptable future.

:::info Example: A Global Gaming Platform

Consider a global gaming platform that operates across multiple jurisdictions, each with its unique set of regulations and compliance requirements. The platform may offer various in-game tokenized assets, currencies, and other gaming primitives that are subject to regulatory oversight. It needs a compliant way to mandate these assets while maintaining access control and network sovereignty for users.

### Highly-functional applications with cross-chain connectivity

Despite regional differences in network infrastructure, Supernets remain highly functional. This is achieved by preserving specific application states within the respective regions that operate the infrastructure. The native cross-chain bridge facilitates seamless connectivity between these regional networks, ensuring efficient and uninterrupted operation.

The appchain design, which incorporates the native cross-chain bridge, is particularly useful for maintaining functionality while adhering to regional regulations. As a result, Supernets enable the development and deployment of compliant and efficient applications in a globally distributed network environment.

## Tokenization and Asset Management

Polygon Supernets offer a versatile environment for launching and managing utility tokens, enabling a wide range of use cases and applications. By granting complete control over the native (gas) token, Supernets facilitate the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens that serve various purposes, such as incentivizing network participants, granting access to network resources, and facilitating transactions.

### Flexibility and incentivization

The ability to mint additional tokens through the Supernet precompile contract endows a given network with the necessary flexibility to manage costs for users and promote network participation. This feature allows network operators to dynamically adjust token supply and distribution, ensuring that the network's economic incentives remain aligned with its overall objectives and user needs.

## EVM Compatibility and Customization

Supernets focus on flexibility, adaptability, and EVM compatibility, streamlining the development process for developers. This design enables tailored blockchain solutions optimized for specific use cases while allowing the use of existing code and familiar programming languages.

### Seamless Development and Deployment

EVM compatibility ensures developers can leverage existing tools and frameworks, simplifying migration and deployment of decentralized applications while maintaining the security and robustness of the underlying infrastructure.

### Application-Specific Chains for Enhanced Efficiency

Supernets provide the option to run application-specific chains, processing user transactions without competing with other decentralized applications. This dedicated environment enhances efficiency, performance, and control over network operations.

Developers can further customize their networks with features such as default transaction fees and their own gas tokens, fine-tuning network performance and user experience.

## Robust Consensus

Supernets utilize the [PolyBFT consensus mechanism](/docs/supernets/consensus/polybft/polybft-overview), purposefully engineered to yield exceptional throughput, minimal latency, and immediate network finality.

</div>

This positions Supernets as a highly suitable platform for an extensive variety of use cases within the Polygon PoS network, even accommodating those that demand substantial blockspace allocations for specialized applications. Through the provision of unparalleled throughput and reduced latency, PolyBFT assures swift and secure transaction processing, a critical element in the thriving landscape of decentralized applications.

## On-chain governance

One of the key benefits of Supernets is the ability to enable on-chain governance. This means that participants of the network have ownership over the architecture of the network and can vote on changes to system parameters. On-chain governance enables participants to have a say in the network's direction, promoting transparency, accountability, and fairness.

Supernets allow for on-chain parameter changes to drive the network and ensure that key design principles are backed by a trusted set of participants and stake, while ensuring security. This distributed approach to governance provides a more democratic and community-driven decision-making process that is transparent and accessible to all participants.

On-chain governance also allows for the creation of impactful proto-jurisdictions that meet the needs of the community. These proto-jurisdictions can define rules and conditions for a particular aspect of the network's operation, such as fee structures, validator selection, and even network upgrades. These rules and protocols can be put in place to ensure that the network remains stable and secure while also promoting innovation and growth.
