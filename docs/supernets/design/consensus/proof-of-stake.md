This document presents an overview of Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), the Proof-of-Stake mechanism of Polygon Supernets. DPoS is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks that employs a voting system to select a fixed number of validators to secure the network.

## Advantages of DPoS

DPoS offers several advantages, including:

- **Scalability**: DPoS is designed to be more scalable than other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW), as it uses a fixed number of validators to secure the network.
- **Efficiency**: DPoS is more energy-efficient than PoW as it does not require complex computations to validate transactions and create new blocks.
- **Security**: DPoS is designed to be more secure than other consensus mechanisms as it uses a tamper-proof and transparent voting system to select validators and prevent collusion and bribery.

## DPoS in Supernets

In the context of the Polygon Supernets, DPoS allows for the customization of the validator set for each network, providing greater flexibility to the consensus mechanism while retaining the benefits of scalability, efficiency, and security.

### Election process

DPoS relies on the election process in which delegators participate by delegating their stake to their preferred validator candidates. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and creating new blocks. Validators are incentivized to act in the network's best interest as they receive rewards for block creation and verification activities.

### Stakeholder participation

In a trustless and permissionless environment, stakeholders can participate in the network by delegating their stake to the validator of their choice. Validators are selected through a tamper-proof and transparent voting system that ensures the selection of validators based on the stakeholders' preferences who are most likely to act in the network's best interest.

### Allowlisting

In a permissioned scenario, such as an organization where all members become delegators to delegate their stake for their organizations validator set, PolyBFT enables the organization to maintain control over the validator set while allowing members to participate in the network by delegating their stake. This arrangement provides additional security and control for the organization while enabling network participation and rewards for all stakeholders.
