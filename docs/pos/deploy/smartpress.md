## Create a Smart Contract using SmartPress

To create a new smart contract using SmartPress, follow the steps below.

1. In your browser, navigate to smartpress.ai
2. Enter the requirements for the contract you want to build.
3. SmartPress will handle it from there and produce your contract for you without you having to use a IDE or a code editor.
4. If you are happy with the output, move onto validating your idea and testing. If you arent happy, edit your prompt and start again.
