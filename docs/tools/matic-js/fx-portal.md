# FxPortal Bridge

FxPortal Bridge is similar to POS Bridge with a feature of using ERC standardized tokens without mapping.

FxPortal bridge functionality is available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/0xPolygon/maticjs-fxportal) as a plugin for maticjs. The package provides different API's for interacting with bridge.
