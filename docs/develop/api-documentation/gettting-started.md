title: Getting Started with RPC API Methods
---

JSON-RPC is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that is commonly used for interacting with the Polygon network layer. As an integral part of the Blockchain Interaction Layer within the [Web3 ecosystem](https://blog.alchemy.com/blog/web3-stack/?a=matic-docs), Polygon JSON-RPC methods allow developers to query for data, write to the blockchain, and build dApps.

## API Documentation

To get started with the API, visit the complete set of API documentation for standard [Polygon JSON-RPC calls](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/apis/polygon-api/?a=matic-docs).

## No-Code API Requests

If you want to get started with API requests with no set-up, fix failing requests, or explore new methods on the Polygon network, try out the [Composer App](https://composer.alchemyapi.io?composer_state=%7B%22chain%22%3A2%2C%22network%22%3A401%2C%22methodName%22%3A%22eth_getBlockByNumber%22%2C%22paramValues%22%3A%5B%22latest%22%2Cfalse%5D%7D).

Composer allows developers to save hours of debugging and building time while also providing a friendly UI for sharing API calls.
