## **Introduction to Replit**:
Replit is a coding platform that lets you write code and host apps. It also has many educational features built-in, making it great for teachers and learners too. Every repl you create is a fully functional development and production environment. Hosting from your editor makes it easy to iterate quickly on your work, collaborate with others, and get feedback.

#### **[Get started with Replet!](https://blog.replit.com/solidity)**

## **Prerequisites**:
To deploy on Polygon using Replit, you donâ€™t need any local environment. You should have a wallet available with testnet funds so that you can deploy and test transactions.

* [Create a Replit account](https://replit.com/~)
* Download [Metamask](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/hello/) & [Configure Polygon](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/)

## **Create a Repl**
After creating your [Replit](https://replit.com/) account, your home screen will include a dashboard where you can view projects, create projects, manage your account, and do many other things. You can get started by creating a new Repl.

* Choose **+ Create Repl** from the left panel or **+** in the top right corner of the screen
* Select the [**Solidity starter (beta)**](https://replit.com/@replit/Solidity-starter-beta?v=1) template and give your project a title
* Click **+ Create Repl** to create your project

Visit [Solidity on Replit](https://blog.replit.com/solidity) for an overview of Features.

## **Deploy on Polygon**
If you donâ€™t have a wallet with [Funds](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) and [Polygon Configuration](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask) please set it up so that you are prepared to deploy and interact with your smart contract.

* Click **Run** (at the Top) to install all relevant packages, start up the contract deployment UI
* Select **Connect wallet**, select your account, then choose Connect.
* Select the contract you would like to deploy from the dropdown (ex. MathTest, SimpleStorage).
* To deploy this contract, select Deploy and confirm the transaction from your wallet.

You can now interact with your contract using the provided user interface or from a sharable URL shown on the interface.

> To view your deployed contract, copy your account address navigate to https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/, and search for your account!

## **Publish to Replitâ€‹**

Among many other features, Replit allows you to publish your projects to a personal profile. After publishing, projects will show up on your spotlight page for others to explore, interact with, clone, and collaborate.
* Select the project title at the top of the screen.
* Complete your project name and description and click Publish.

That's it, you are done. ðŸŽ‰
